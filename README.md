# README

GEMS:
random_util

Set up two private git repositories (please use GitHub, as they allow you to create free private
repositories; this will prevent future applicants from copying your code).
When committing, we suggest that your first commit should only add the files from the
unmodified base install, to distinguish your code from the boilerplate. Also, please make sure all
your commits have meaningful and descriptive commit messages.

In addition to testing locally, please deploy your API code to Heroku (using the free tier) and
your SPA code to Netlify (also free) so we can review a live demo. When you’ve completed the
challenge, give the Prota code reviewers access to your repositories (share with Guthub
usernames: rbuterbaugh, valthon, wclittle, and gabecoyne) and email your recruiting contact
with your project’s live URL to let us know that your code is ready for review.
The expectation is that you should be able to implement all the core requirements within 2-4
hours of total software development time. Stretch goals are opportunities to demonstrate
additional skills. Please feel free to do any subset or skip them entirely -- they are optional. Ask
us questions early and often if you get stuck or don’t understand what to build; we very much
welcome dialog as you are working through this.
